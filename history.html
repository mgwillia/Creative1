                <h1>About the game</h1>
                <p>The vision behind Fauxnopoly was pretty simple. Build a game that's horrible, and then try to convince everyone
                    it's awesome. Every since it's creation, that's been our goal: Fun. Fun is our mission. Not necessarily
                    for you the customer, the reader, but for us, the staff, the creators.</p>
                <p>Fauxnopoly started as a simple idea. Assigned a creative project in a web programming class but afraid to
                    infringe on copyrights, Matt Gwilliam decided to make a site dedicated to helping users navigate the
                    intricacies of a fake parody game:
                    <em>Fauxnpoloy</em>. While rules were never created, and the game may or may not exist, the idea has half-materialized
                    as a series of interest jokes at the expense of a variety of different obscure real estate options.
                </p>
                <p>The success of the game has been varied. Critical response often takes the form of questions, with many offering
                    insightful remarks such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"What is that?"</li>
                    <li>"What does that mean?"</li>
                    <li>"Huh?"</li>
                    <li>"Sorry, could you repeat that again?"</li>
                    <li>"Oh, so it's kind of like _______?"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    It's estimated that in 2018 alone at least 2 different peole have visited the
                    <em>Fauxnopoly Aid</em> site. The creator, Matt, is hard at work producing more web content that will most
                    likely have nothing to do with
                    <em>Fauxnopoly</em>.
